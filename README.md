## General Information

This project was built as part of my time in the July 2022 cohort at Alchemy Code Lab in Portland, Oregon.

## Features

This backend application uses Express to create a server and Postgres to create a database. It includes the functionality to Create Read Update and Delete books from the database.

## Scripts

| Command                | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`            | Starts the app - should only be used in production as changes will not get reloaded |
| `npm run start:watch`  | Runs the app using `nodemon` which watches for changes and reloads the app          |
| `npm test`             | Runs the tests once                                                                 |
| `npm run test:watch`   | Continually watches and runs the tests when files are updated                       |
| `npm run setup-db`     | Sets up the database locally                                                        |
| `npm run setup-heroku` | Sets up the database on Heroku                                                      |

## Run Locally

1. Make sure you have node installed
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Create a dotenv file just like the example, except with unique values for the variables
4. Ports 8080 & 5432
